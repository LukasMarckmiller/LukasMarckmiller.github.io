Websocket based discord bot in GO with Overwatch stats API integration.
You can also copy an piece of code written for this project, and use it in your own project without any restrictions.
Im aware that there is this pretty good discord bindings api out, which also supports websocket connections. But i wanted to write my own small layer.
OverwatchDiscordBot is now listed on the discordbotlist. Vote here
The bot is currently running on an Odroid XU4Q
